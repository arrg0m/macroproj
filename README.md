# Effects of investment-specific technology shocks in Korea

Source codes accompanying my master thesis (2018), where you can find the original paper (written in Korean) from [KAIST Library](http://library.kaist.ac.kr/search/ctlgSearch/posesn/view.do?bibctrlno=842576&se=t0&ty=B&_csrf=8dd4449c-82ec-4646-ba81-af1ef336b130), with some codes from Spring 2017 Class of Green Economics in KAIST Business School.

MATLAB codes for programming assignment and research are mainly based on [Martin Uribe's Second-Order Approximation Toolbox](http://www.columbia.edu/~mu2166/2nd_order.htm).

It's been a long time since the work, but I'll try to document and refine the codes whenever possible. Note that I don't have a MATLAB account now so It might be not that easy... but there should be some works - like simple refactoring and documentation - that I can do.
